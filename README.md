# Computer-Vision-Systems-Project
This project can spot and ID many people and objects in a changing setting, using a Raspberry Pi 4 and camera. The system marks person and object with a confidence score. The main issue is getting face and object ID to work well with low delay under different lighting and setting situations. It uses face detection and ID methods to process video.
